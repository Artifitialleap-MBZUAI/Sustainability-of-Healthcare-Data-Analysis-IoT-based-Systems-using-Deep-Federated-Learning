# Sustainability-of-Healthcare-Data-Analysis-IoT-based-Systems-using-Deep-Federated-Learning


This project is the implementation of the experiment proposed in "Sustainability of Healthcare Data Analysis IoT-based Systems using Deep Federated Learning" for emplying DFL for Skin disease detection. The experiment consists of two parts: 
1- Building a global skin diseases detection model using transfer learning.
2- Applying FL to preserve data privacy and support decentralization.
